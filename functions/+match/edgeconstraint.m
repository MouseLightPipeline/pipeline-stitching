% below is a nice trick to compansate for any stage movement errors.
% Sometimes, stage move x-um, which results in X-pixels, but if you look at
% images, they are X +/- eps, where eps can be around 3-4 pixels. By taking
% out, p(3) which corresponds to shift, we get better estimate
difs = ( init_vals-pinit(3) - (iter_vals-x(3))); 

c = norm(difs);
ceq = [];
